# Vibe Marketing Skill

Build products that spread themselves through authentic emotional resonance and embedded viral mechanics.

## Core Framework: VIBE

- **Velocity** - Speed of viral cycle (signup → share → new signup)
- **Identity** - Emotional resonance and brand authenticity
- **Boundaryless** - Cross-platform, cross-community spread
- **Emotions** - Sharing driven by feeling, not incentives

## Decision Tree: Growth Strategy Selection

```
Product has network effects? (users benefit from other users)
    ├─ Yes → Design embedded viral loop
    │         ├─ Multi-party workflow? → Embedded loop (Calendly model)
    │         ├─ Creates shareable output? → UGC loop (Canva model)
    │         └─ Has visible usage? → Casual contact loop (Slack model)
    │
    └─ No → Evaluate referral program viability
            ├─ High LTV product? → Two-sided incentive program
            ├─ Community-driven? → Status/recognition rewards
            └─ Transactional? → Consider if viral growth is the right channel
```

## Quick Start: Viral Loop Audit

Run this diagnostic on any product:

1. **Map current sharing behavior**
   - Where do users already share? (Slack, Twitter, email)
   - What do they screenshot/mention?
   - At what moment do they share?

2. **Calculate current K factor**
   ```
   K = (users who invite) × (invites per user) × (conversion rate)

   Example:
   - 10% of users send invites
   - They send 3 invites each
   - 15% of invites convert
   K = 0.10 × 3 × 0.15 = 0.045 (very low)
   ```

3. **Identify loop acceleration opportunities**
   - Can sharing be embedded in workflow?
   - Can friction be reduced (1-click share)?
   - Can recipient value be increased?

4. **Model improvements**
   ```
   If we embed sharing in workflow: 40% share (vs 10%)
   If we add 1-click: 5 shares each (vs 3)
   If we improve landing page: 25% convert (vs 15%)

   New K = 0.40 × 5 × 0.25 = 0.5 (10x improvement)
   ```

## Viral Loop Patterns

### Embedded Loops (K = 0.5-2.0+)
For products where sharing IS using:

```
Pattern: Calendly Model
User creates → Shares link to complete task → Recipient sees product → Converts

Implementation:
- Make output shareable by default
- Recipient MUST interact with product
- Signup optional but prominent
- Recipient gets immediate value without account
```

### User-Generated Content Loops (K = 0.3-1.0)
For products that create shareable outputs:

```
Pattern: Spotify Wrapped Model
User uses product → Creates personalized content → Shares on social → Viewers convert

Implementation:
- Auto-generate shareable assets at milestones
- Make output identity-reinforcing
- Include subtle product attribution
- Optimize for platform-native formats
```

### Community Loops (K = 0.2-0.5)
For products with strong community dynamics:

```
Pattern: Discord Community Model
Power users create content → Community grows → Attracts new users → Some become power users

Implementation:
- Identify and empower power users
- Create incentives for content creation
- Make community discoverable (SEO, social)
- Lower barrier from lurker to participant
```

## Research Current Trends

Before executing growth strategy, research current trends:

1. **Web search for current examples**: Search "[industry] viral marketing 2026" to find recent case studies

2. **Analyze working examples**: For any viral product, diagram:
   - What's the loop? (User A → ? → User B)
   - What's the K factor? (estimate from growth data)
   - What accelerated it? (timing, format, platform)

3. **Platform-specific trends**: Each platform has current best practices
   - TikTok: Current trending formats and sounds
   - LinkedIn: Post formats getting algorithmic boost
   - Twitter/X: Thread structures, engagement patterns

## 2026 Context

Key shifts to incorporate:

- **Lo-fi > polished**: iPhone footage outperforms production
- **B2B on TikTok**: 340% increase in B2B content engagement
- **Micro-moments**: 7-15 second single-benefit demonstrations
- **Community-first**: Months of value before any promotion
- **Trust as currency**: Authenticity beats optimization

## Red Flags

- **Bolted-on referral programs**: If sharing isn't embedded, K stays low
- **Gimmicks over architecture**: One-time stunts don't compound
- **Trend-chasing without identity**: Hopping on memes, standing for nothing
- **Vanity metrics**: Views without conversion, shares without signups
- **Ignoring natural sharing**: Users show you the loop—watch them

## Shipping Checklist

Before launching viral initiative:
- [ ] Viral loop diagrammed (User A → Action → User B)
- [ ] K factor estimated with realistic assumptions
- [ ] Sharing embedded in natural usage (not bolted on)
- [ ] Recipient value proposition clear
- [ ] Friction minimized (1-click maximum)
- [ ] Analytics instrumented for K and cycle time
- [ ] Authentic to brand identity
- [ ] Web search for current trend context completed
