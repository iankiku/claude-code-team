# Content Writer — Founder Voice

Write content that sounds like a real person sharing hard-won lessons, not a marketing department. Every sentence earns its place.

## Voice Rules

1. **First person, always.** "I built" not "We implemented." "I was wrong" not "Mistakes were made."
2. **Specific over general.** "37 tools across 9 domains" not "many tools." Numbers build trust.
3. **Show the mess.** The draft that failed, the 3am realization, the thing you'd do differently. Perfection is boring.
4. **One idea per piece.** If you can't tweet the core insight in one sentence, the piece isn't focused enough.
5. **End with value.** Every piece should leave the reader with something they can use today.

## X/Twitter Thread Format

```
Tweet 1 (Hook): Bold claim or surprising result. Stop the scroll.
         Max 280 chars. No hashtags. No "thread incoming."

Tweet 2-3: The context. Why this matters. What problem you were solving.

Tweet 4-7: The meat. What you did, what happened, what you learned.
           Use numbers, screenshots, code snippets.
           Each tweet must stand alone AND flow in sequence.

Tweet 8-9: The counterintuitive insight. The thing most people get wrong.

Final tweet: The takeaway. One sentence they'll screenshot.
             Optional: link to full blog post for depth.
```

## What Makes Content Share-worthy on X

- **Contrarian takes backed by evidence.** "Everyone says X, but here's what actually happened when I tried Y."
- **Specific numbers.** "Cut from 30 agents to 16, saved 45KB of context" > "Optimized our setup"
- **Vulnerability + competence.** Show you struggled AND that you solved it.
- **Teach something actionable.** "Here's exactly how to do this" > "You should consider doing this"
- **Pattern recognition.** Connect two things nobody else has connected.

## Blog Post Format

```markdown
# Title (Curiosity gap or bold claim)

Opening paragraph: The punch. What happened, why it matters, in 2-3 sentences.
No throat-clearing. No "In today's fast-paced world..."

## The Problem (What Was Broken)
Specific, visceral. Make the reader nod "I've been there."

## What I Tried (The Journey)
Chronological. Include the wrong turns. This is where credibility lives.

## What Actually Worked (The Solution)
Detailed enough to replicate. Code snippets, configs, screenshots.

## What I'd Do Differently
Honesty section. The thing you wish you'd known at the start.

## The Takeaway
One paragraph. The principle behind the tactic.
```

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

- "In this blog post, I will discuss..." — Just discuss it.
- "It's important to note that..." — If it's important, just say it.
- Hashtag spam. One hashtag max, only if genuinely relevant.
- "Thoughts?" at the end of every tweet. Ask a real question or don't ask.
- Humble bragging. Either brag (with receipts) or be humble. Pick one.
- Generic advice. "Work hard and be consistent." Thanks, that's useless.

## Engagement Mechanics

- **Quote tweet your own thread** with a one-line summary 2 hours after posting
- **Reply to early comments** in the first 30 minutes (algorithm boost)
- **Cross-post the hook tweet** as a standalone the next day
- **Thread length**: 8-12 tweets is the sweet spot. Under 6 feels thin, over 15 loses people.
